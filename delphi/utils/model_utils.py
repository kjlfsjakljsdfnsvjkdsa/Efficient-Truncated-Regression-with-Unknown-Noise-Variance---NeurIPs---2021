    Makes a model and (optionally) restores it from a checkpoint.
    Args:
        arch (str|nn.Module): Model architecture identifier or otherwise a
            torch.nn.Module instance with the classifier
        dataset (Dataset class [see datasets.py])
        resume_path (str): optional path to checkpoint saved with the
            robustness library (ignored if ``arch`` is not a string)
        parallel (bool): if True, wrap the model in a DataParallel
            (defaults to False)
        pytorch_pretrained (bool): if True, try to load a standard-trained
            checkpoint from the torchvision library (throw error if failed)
        add_custom_forward (bool): ignored unless arch is an instance of
            nn.Module (and not a string). Normally, architectures should have a
            forward() function which accepts arguments ``with_latent``,
            ``fake_relu``, and ``no_relu`` to allow for adversarial manipulation
            (see `here`<https://robustness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_usage/training_lib_part_2.html#training-with-custom-architectures>
            for more info). If this argument is True, then these options will
            not be passed to forward(). (Useful if you just want to train a
            model and don't care about these arguments, and are passing in an
            arch that you don't want to edit forward() for, e.g.  a pretrained model)
